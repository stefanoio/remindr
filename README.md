# Remindr
## Continue your reading where you left off.

Remindr is a small (<1KB) utility that reminds where users left your article and helps to recover their reading. Basically it stores the scrolling position inside localstorage and resets it when the user come back.

It works on any modern and not-so-prehistoric browser (IE9+) and has no dependency from any library. Just drop it on your page and let it do its thing.

Hereâ€™s a demo: http://stefano.io/remindr/demo.html

To build a minified version inside the dist folder you can use:
```
npm install && npm run build
```
